# Which property characteristics influence AirBnB prices and does booking early always guarantee a lower price?

## Purpose and motivation
Airbnb offers many tourists and travelers a relatively affordable and convenient accomodation option and home owners an extra source of income. This project aims to estimate the effects of (a) listing characteristics  and (b) time until the booking starts on the price of the listing. The findings of this reasearch will aid Airbnb hosts in the developing a suitable pricing strategy based on the characteristics of the properties they own. Moreover, in this project we investigate all Hawaiian AirBnB listings and look into the seasonal differences of the listing prices. The data in this projects is sourced from [AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/)  

## Research question
What is the effect of listing characteristics on the price per night of Hawaiian Airbnb listings and how does this effect differ per season? 

### Listing characteristics and corresponding variable names
Room type (room_type), number of guest (accomodates), number of baths (bathrooms_text), number of bedrooms (bedrooms), number of beds (beds), review scores rating (review_scores_rating), whether the guests can automatically book the listing without host's approval (instant_bookable)
